Technical Assessment: Deliverables
-------------------------------------
1. Create table queries

CREATE TABLE Table_India (
    customer_name VARCHAR(255),
    customer_id VARCHAR(18),
    open_date DATE,
    last_consulted_date DATE,
    vaccination_id CHAR(5),
    doctor_name VARCHAR(255),
    state CHAR(5),
    country CHAR(5),
    post_code INT,
    dob DATE,
    is_active CHAR(1),
    age INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(dob)) VIRTUAL,
    days_since_last_consulted INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), last_consulted_date)) VIRTUAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)
);


2. Create the above tables with additional derived columns: age and days since last consulted >30

CREATE TABLE Table_India (
    customer_name VARCHAR(255),
    customer_id VARCHAR(18),
    open_date DATE,
    last_consulted_date DATE,
    vaccination_id CHAR(5),
    doctor_name VARCHAR(255),
    state CHAR(5),
    country CHAR(5),
    post_code INT,
    dob DATE,
    is_active CHAR(1),
    
    -- Derived columns
    age INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(dob)) VIRTUAL,
    days_since_last_consulted INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), last_consulted_date)) VIRTUAL,
    flag_days_gt_30 CHAR(1) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), last_consulted_date) > 30 THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END) VIRTUAL,
    
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)
);

3. Create necessary validations.

CREATE TABLE Table_India (
    customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- Mandatory
    customer_id VARCHAR(18) NOT NULL,     -- Mandatory
    open_date DATE NOT NULL,              -- Mandatory
    last_consulted_date DATE,
    vaccination_id CHAR(5),
    doctor_name VARCHAR(255),
    state CHAR(5),
    country CHAR(5),
    post_code INT,
    dob DATE,
    is_active CHAR(1) NOT NULL,           -- Mandatory

    -- Derived columns
    age INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(dob)) VIRTUAL,
    days_since_last_consulted INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), last_consulted_date)) VIRTUAL,
    flag_days_gt_30 CHAR(1) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), last_consulted_date) > 30 THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END) VIRTUAL,
    
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)
);


4. If we move forward with an interview we would like to see the demonstration

	Great! I'd be happy to help you prepare for the demonstration. Could you let me know what specific technologies, tools, or processes you'd
 like to showcase during the interview? This will help me assist you with creating an effective demonstration plan.
